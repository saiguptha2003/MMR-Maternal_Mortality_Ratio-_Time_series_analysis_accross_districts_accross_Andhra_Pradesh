<h1><span style="font-family: 'Tahoma, sans-serif';">Understanding the trends in Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) A time series analysis across districts across Andhra Pradesh</span></h1>

<h4>This Project is helps people who are belongs Andhra Pradesh State Government to analysis the data regarding the HMIS Data Indicators.</h4>

All the resource files are collected from https://hmis.mohfw.gov.in/#!/standardReports website which is maintained by Central Government for the perpose of Grading of Health Facilities, identifications of aspirational districts, review of State Programme Implementation Plan (PIPs), etc.
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
Health Management Information Systems (HMIS) are one of the six building blocks essential for health system strengthening. HMIS is a data collection system specifically designed to support planning, management, and decision making in health facilities and organizations.

MEASURE Evaluation worked in Ethiopia to implement a HMIS in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (SNNPR) and Oromia. The following training materials were used to support implementation of the HMIS including data quality assurance and information use procedures, the electronic HMIS system for managing data processing, reporting, analysis and use; and the  and the community health information system (CHIS), which organizes information on individuals and families information related to vaccines, family planning, maternal and child health, HIV treatment and support, and other services—and makes it available all in one place, such as a family folder.

<h3>what is Maternal Mortality Rate(MMR)?</h3>
Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births due to pregnancy or termination of pregnancy, regardless of the site or duration of pregnancy. The maternal mortality rate is used to represent the risk associated with pregnancy among women.
Limitations:
Maternal mortality is difficult to measure. CRVS and health information systems in most developing countries are weak, and thus, cannot provide an accurate assessment of maternal mortality. Even estimates derived from complete CRVS systems, such as those in developed countries; suffer from misclassification and underreporting of maternal deaths.
Method of calculation:
The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100,000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death. Maternal mortality ratio = (Number of maternal deaths / Number of live births) X 100,000 The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. However, there are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take into account these data quality issues. Adjustments for underreporting and misclassification of deaths and model-based estimates should be made in the cases where data are not reliable. Because maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used. This is very costly and may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross-country or overtime comparisons. To reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and MICS surveys measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy-related mortality: regardless of cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth, or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio. Reproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify all deaths of women of reproductive age and ascertain which of these are maternal or pregnancy-related.

<h3>What is Infant Mortality Rate(IMR)?</h3>
nfant mortality represents an important component of under-five mortality. Like under-five mortality, infant mortality rates measure child survival. They also reflect the social, economic and environmental conditions in which children (and others in society) live, including their health care. Since data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases (morbidity data) frequently are unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. Infant mortality rate is an MDG indicator.
